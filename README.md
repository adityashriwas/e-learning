### API Architecture

The backend follows a RESTful API design with the following main endpoints:

- **`/api/v1/user`**: User authentication and profile management
- **`/api/v1/course`**: Course CRUD operations and search
- **`/api/v1/media`**: Media upload to Cloudinary
- **`/api/v1/purchase`**: Payment processing and webhooks
- **`/api/v1/progress`**: Course progress tracking

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)
- **Stripe Account** for payment processing
- **Cloudinary Account** for media storage
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityashriwas/e-learning.git
   cd LMS-main
   ```

2. **Install Server Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Client Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

1. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

2. **Start the Frontend Application** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
   The client will start on `http://localhost:5173`

#### Production Build

```bash
# Build the client
cd client
npm run build

# Start the server (serves both API and static files)
cd ../server
npm start
```

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

### Server Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Client Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Stripe Webhook Setup (Local Development)

To test payment webhooks locally, use the Stripe CLI:

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
# https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhook events to your local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/api/v1/purchase/webhook
```

### Additional Server Environment Variables (New)

The following variables were added for safer local/prod switching and runtime hardening:

```env
# Comma-separated origins allowed for CORS
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173

# Single frontend URL used by Stripe success/cancel redirects
FRONTEND_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Cookie behavior (optional overrides)
COOKIE_SECURE=false
COOKIE_SAME_SITE=Lax

# Basic in-memory rate-limiter configuration
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=300
```

## • Recent Updates

This section documents newly added improvements while preserving all existing project docs above.

### Security and Authorization
- Added stricter course/lecture ownership checks for instructor actions.
- Fixed sensitive auth response handling by sanitizing user payloads before returning them.
- Added security headers and basic request rate limiting in backend runtime.
- Added env-driven cookie policy for local vs production compatibility.

### Purchase Reliability and Enrollment Consistency
- Added Stripe checkout session verification API:
  - `POST /api/v1/purchase/checkout/session/:sessionId/verify`
- Checkout success URL now includes `session_id` and the frontend verifies payment on return.
- Purchase finalization is now idempotent and shared between webhook + verify flow.
- This ensures enrolled students count, "My Learning", instructor sales dashboard, and "Continue Course" state update correctly.

### Performance and UX
- Added route-level lazy loading/code splitting to improve initial page load.
- Removed duplicate auth bootstrap to reduce startup overhead.
- Improved auth-route loading behavior to avoid unnecessary full-screen blocking.
- Fixed responsive issues in instructor mobile layout and footer.

### Developer Experience / Local vs Deploy
- Added `client/.env.example` and `server/.env.example`.
- Added dynamic frontend API base URL resolver (env-first with safe defaults).
- Added backend smoke test script (`npm run smoke`) for quick post-deploy verification.
